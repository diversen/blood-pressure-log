### What is blood pressure?

Blood pressure is the force of blood exerted on the walls of the arteries as it flows through them. It is the measure of how hard the heart has to work to circulate blood throughout the body. Blood pressure is an important indicator of cardiovascular health and is one of the vital signs that doctors use to assess overall health and measure the risk of heart disease and stroke.

The blood pressure reading is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is expressed as two numbers, the systolic and diastolic pressures. The systolic pressure is the higher number and represents the force of blood against the arterial walls when the heart contracts or beats. The diastolic pressure is the lower number and represents the pressure against the arterial walls when the heart is at rest between beats.

Normal blood pressure ranges from 90/60 mm Hg to 120/80 mm Hg. However, blood pressure can vary depending on various factors such as age, gender, activity level, stress, medications, and underlying medical conditions. When blood pressure consistently measures above 140/90 mm Hg, it is considered high blood pressure or hypertension. High blood pressure can damage the arteries and increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health complications.

On the other hand, low blood pressure or hypotension occurs when blood pressure consistently measures below 90/60 mm Hg. Although low blood pressure is not usually a health concern, in severe cases, it can lead to inadequate blood flow to the organs and cause dizziness, fainting, and other symptoms.

Several factors can affect blood pressure, including lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise, smoking, and excessive alcohol use. High levels of stress and anxiety can also elevate blood pressure. Additionally, some medical conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, and sleep apnea, can increase the risk of hypertension.

It is essential to monitor blood pressure regularly, especially for individuals with high blood pressure or a family history of cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle interventions, including following a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, limiting alcohol consumption, and managing stress, can help lower blood pressure and improve overall cardiovascular health. In some cases, medications may be necessary to manage high blood pressure and prevent complications.

In conclusion, blood pressure is a crucial indicator of cardiovascular health and wellness. Consistently elevated blood pressure can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, while lowering it can improve overall health and quality of life. Understanding and managing blood pressure is essential for optimal health and well-being.
