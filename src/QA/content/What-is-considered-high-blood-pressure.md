### What is considered high blood pressure?

High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Hypertension is a medical condition in which the pressure of blood against the walls of the arteries is persistently elevated higher than normal. The measurement of blood pressure is essential in determining whether a person has high blood pressure or not. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and is expressed as two numbers, the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure.

The systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heartbeats. The diastolic pressure is the pressure between heartbeats, when the heart rests. A normal blood pressure reading is usually around 120/80 mmHg, where 120 is the systolic pressure and 80 the diastolic pressure. However, the definition of high blood pressure has changed over the years. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) updated the guidelines for diagnosing and treating hypertension.

According to the updated guidelines, a blood pressure reading of 130/80 mmHg or higher is considered high blood pressure. Previously, a reading of 140/90 mmHg or higher was considered high blood pressure. The new guidelines were developed after reviewing years of research on the effects of high blood pressure on health. The lower threshold for high blood pressure was recommended because studies have shown that people with blood pressure readings within the range of 130-139/80-89 mmHg have a higher risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease than those with normal blood pressure.

High blood pressure is a serious health condition that can damage the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart attacks, strokes, and other complications. It is often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms, and people may be unaware that they have hypertension. It is therefore important to regularly check blood pressure to determine whether it is within the normal range or not.

If a blood pressure reading is high, measures should be taken to reduce it to the normal range. Lifestyle modifications such as reducing salt intake, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, losing weight, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol consumption can help lower blood pressure. In some cases, medication may also be necessary to manage high blood pressure.

In conclusion, high blood pressure is a medical condition that occurs when the pressure of blood against the walls of the arteries is persistently elevated higher than normal. The updated guidelines by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) define a reading of 130/80 mmHg or higher as high blood pressure. High blood pressure is a serious health condition that requires regular monitoring and management to reduce the risk of complications. A healthy lifestyle and medication can help manage high blood pressure effectively.
